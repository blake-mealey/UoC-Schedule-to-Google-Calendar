# UoC Schedule to Google Calendar

A quick way to create a Google calendar from my UoC schedule. Plan for the future is to turn this into a web app which anyone can use. I made a [Trello page](https://trello.com/b/uSXlQs6L/uoc-course-planning-tools) which describes this project and it's goals as well as some other projects I have planned which are related to it.
